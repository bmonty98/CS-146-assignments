 here we got our khans algortithm where we have:
    
    @param adjacencyA made from the 2D list of the prerequisites nodes
    
    @param totalNodes is the total abount of nodes recieved from the number of courses (nodes)
    
    @param indegreecounter is a list connecting the value of the # of indegrees in the corresponding classes
    
    return true or false: -> if all classes can be taken in right order then true, if not ( not a DAG) return false
