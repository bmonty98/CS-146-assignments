 * Step1: Use a Queue Data Structure (I represented this with an Arraylist lol, tried using a priority queue and it became more complicated then I wanted), then what we do is check if root is check if Null, then return null if thats the case.
 * Step2: do a while loop that constantly checks i the queue is empty and creates a sublist
 * Step3: do a while and for loop for as long as the current length of the last level queue size before every loop updates it, which would represent the nodes in one level of tree
 * Step4: then at the end concatenate that inner list into the main list whch represents are BST transversal and then return it
 * READY GO!
