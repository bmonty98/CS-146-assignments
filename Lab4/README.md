Lab 4: we used a recursive method here to be able to invert a binary search tree, meaning... we are turning the left children to right children and right children to left children. We do this by flipping the pointers of the children of a node and recursively continue until we hit a root node. as well as this use a method that helps print out trees to command line so we can see the inversion of the BST
